OWASP OWTF, the Offensive (Web) Testing Framework, is an OWASP+PTES-focused try to unite great tools and make pen testing more efficient, written mostly in python. The purpose of this tool is to automate the manual, uncreative part of pen testing, so that pen-testers will have more time to focus on the big picture and think out of box. This tool is highly configurable and extensible, allowing the users to implement their own plugins/tests where and when needed.  

There are many vulnerabilities which have the ability to obtain control over the system, elevate privileges or obtain information about the vulnerable host. These exposures may also be used as a stepping stone towards gaining access to the system.

Following are the links which contain reports for all the vulnerabilities mentioned in OWASP and also steps to prevent it. Added to it is the CVSS Base score of each vulnerability.:
